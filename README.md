# Java_Game_Mastermind
A project wherein I created a Java game that will create a random password. 
A player will get 12 tries to get the correct answer. 

The program can tell a player how many numbers they guessed correctly and whether they are in the correct position in the password. 
e.g. 1234 is the password. 
  If the user guesses 8734.
  They have guessed two out of four numbers correctly and two numbers are in the correct place.
